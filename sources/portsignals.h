/** @file portsignals.h
 *
 *  Contains definitions for signals used/intercepted in FORM.
 *
 *	Some systems (especially LINUX) have not enough 
 *	signals available so some of the (!documented!) signals
 *	are not defined. This file contains the definition of all
 *	signals used in the program.
 *	If the signal is not defined we define it as unused (>NSIG).
 *
 *	The include of signal.h must be first, before we try to define
 *	undefined signals.
